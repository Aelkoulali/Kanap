## Back End Prerequisites : 

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

## Back End Installation : 

### Clone this repo. From the "back" folder of the project, run `npm install`.
### You can then run the server with `node server`. 
### The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. 
### If the server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
